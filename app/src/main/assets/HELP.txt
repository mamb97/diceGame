Welcome to the Dice Game created by Trieu, Merlina, Mayuri, Madhurima and Eswara.

Here are the game rules:

1. Game is played by two players : Computer and Human

2. Computer (AI) is always going to be the first player

3. The computer rolls two dices and draws two random numbers between 1 to 6

4. Human player first chooses a number between 1 to 6 from the given dice images and then rolls a dice and draws a random number

5. Using logic “modulo by 6” to total number, the DiceGameApp calculates the results for each party

6. The player who rolls a larger number (after applying “modulo by 6”) to the total number, WINS.

7. Game can be replayed using "reset" option
